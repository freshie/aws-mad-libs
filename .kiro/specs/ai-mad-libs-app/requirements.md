# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a multiplayer Mad Libs party game application that generates entertaining fill-in-the-blank stories using AI. Multiple players can join a game session, set their usernames, and contribute words of specific types. The AI will create original story templates, generate images for each paragraph based on the words, and create a final video presentation of the complete story. The game is designed to feel like a Jackbox party game experience.
