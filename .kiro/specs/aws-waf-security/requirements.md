# AWS WAF Security Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Enhance the existing AWS WAF configuration to provide comprehensive DDoS protection and bot detection for the Mad Libs game application while ensuring legitimate users can access the service without interruption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DDoS Protection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be protected from DDoS attacks, so that legitimate users can always access the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DDoS attack occurs THEN the WAF SHALL block malicious traffic before it reaches the origin
2. WHEN legitimate users access the site THEN they SHALL experience no interruption during normal usage
3. WHEN attack traffic is detected THEN CloudWatch metrics SHALL be generated for monitoring
4. WHEN the application receives high traffic THEN rate limiting SHALL prevent origin overload

### Requirement 2: Bot Detection and Blocking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to block malicious bots and scrapers, so that they cannot abuse the AI generation APIs or consume resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a malicious bot attempts to access the site THEN the WAF SHALL block the request
2. WHEN legitimate search engine crawlers access the site THEN they SHALL be allowed through
3. WHEN bot traffic is detected THEN it SHALL be logged for analysis
4. WHEN automated scripts attempt API abuse THEN they SHALL be rate limited or blocked

### Requirement 3: Appropriate Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a game player, I want to be able to generate multiple stories and images quickly, so that the rate limiting doesn't interfere with normal gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user plays the game normally THEN they SHALL NOT be rate limited
2. WHEN a user generates multiple stories in succession THEN they SHALL be able to do so within reasonable limits (up to 1,000 requests per minute per IP)
3. WHEN an IP makes excessive requests (over 1,000 per minute) THEN it SHALL be temporarily rate limited
4. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the user SHALL receive a clear error message

### Requirement 4: Testing and Monitoring Capabilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to test the WAF configuration and monitor its effectiveness, so that I can ensure it's working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WAF rules are triggered THEN metrics SHALL be available in CloudWatch
2. WHEN testing the WAF THEN there SHALL be a way to simulate attacks safely
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN WAF logs SHALL be accessible for analysis
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN alerts SHALL be generated

### Requirement 5: Static Asset Optimization

**User Story:** As a game player, I want the game assets to load quickly, so that I have a smooth gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading static assets THEN they SHALL be served efficiently through CloudFront
2. WHEN accessing cached content THEN it SHALL NOT count against API rate limits
3. WHEN images are generated THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately
4. WHEN the same assets are requested multiple times THEN they SHALL be served from cache
