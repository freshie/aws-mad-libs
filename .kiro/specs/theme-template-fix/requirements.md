# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ThemeSelector component is not properly waiting for AI template generation to complete before calling the onComplete callback. This results in the "No template provided by ThemeSelector, using fallback" warning and suboptimal user experience. The component should either wait for the AI template to be ready or use the fallback template directly instead of passing null.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the theme selection to provide a proper story template so that I get the best possible Mad Libs experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ThemeSelector completes theme selection THEN it SHALL provide either an AI-generated template or a fallback template
2. WHEN the AI template generation is still in progress THEN the ThemeSelector SHALL wait for completion before calling onComplete
3. WHEN the AI template generation fails THEN the ThemeSelector SHALL use the fallback template instead of passing null
4. WHEN the ThemeSelector calls onComplete THEN it SHALL never pass null or undefined as the template parameter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback about template generation status so that I can debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI template generation is successful THEN the system SHALL log success and use the AI template
2. WHEN the AI template generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and use fallback template
3. WHEN using fallback template THEN the system SHALL log that fallback is being used (not as a warning)
4. WHEN template generation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent timing in the theme selection process so that the experience feels polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI template is ready quickly THEN the ThemeSelector SHALL still maintain minimum display time for smooth UX
2. WHEN the AI template takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the ThemeSelector SHALL proceed with fallback template
3. WHEN using fallback template due to timeout THEN the user SHALL not experience any delay or error
4. WHEN the theme selection completes THEN the transition to word collection SHALL be smooth and immediate
